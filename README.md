I encountered some issues with a pseudo-element used in the layout, and the only way to replicate the exact design would have required using hacks(in my opinion) such as setting a min-height of 2000px on the ::before element.
I tried to respect the layout given 
as much as possible, but in the end I wanted a clear layout and a clean code without any hacks or artificial values.
